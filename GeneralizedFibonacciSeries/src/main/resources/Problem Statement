Problem Statement    -   Fibonacci Madness
###############################################################################################


A Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively by:

F0 = 0
F1 = 1
Fn = Fn − 1 + Fn − 2, for integer n > 1.

One way of generalizing the Fibonacci sequence is by starting with any pair of numbers and extending to negative values of n.

Given two terms of a generalized Fibonacci sequence Fp and Fq, their positions p and q respectively and a position r, find Fr.
Input Format

The first line of the input contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains three lines.

    First line of each test case contains two space separated integers p and Fp
    Second line contains two space separated integers q and Fq
    Third line contains an integer r

Output Format

For each test case, print Fr which is the term of the sequence at position r.

If Fr is not an integer, represent it as an irreducible fraction in the form a/b where b > 0.
